# MachineLearningStanford-solutions
Implemented Machine Learning Algorithms in Matlab for the machine learning course on coursera. It aims to help students in the course complete their assignments, by getting help implementing the algorithms


### Included Algorithms:
* Batch Linear Regression
* MuliLinear Regression (Matrix Solution)
* Logistic Regression
* Regularized Logistic Regression
* One vs All Regularized Logistic Regression
    Project: MNIST dataset for digit recognition, Accuracy ~ 94 %
* Feedforward Neural Networks 
    Project: MNIST dataset for digit recognition, Accuracy ~ 97 %
    
More algorithms will be implemented and committed soon
